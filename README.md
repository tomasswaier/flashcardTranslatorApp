Generic app for making flashcards of words which you want to remember from another language and then going trough those flashcard. 

From my experience apps that are made for you to learn words form another language are great but only after you pay for premium. I want an app which will allow me to have unlimited flashcards (some apps have limit of 10) and built in translation (again some apps have it only in premium). From the whole lot of 2 apps which I tried I found non which would fit these criteria so this is the result of my efforts in trying to make one that has both features.
